1. Understanding the Role of an Interpreter - Substitution Model
   
   > Applying a compound procedure to actual arguments means evaluating the procedure body with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding actual argument.
   > 
   > The substitution model here is just the first step among these models, formally considering this evaluation process. In general, when simulating phenomena in scientific research or engineering, we always start with the simplest incomplete models. As we delve deeper into the problem under consideration, these simple models become increasingly inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models.

2. Two Evaluation Models - Normal Order Evaluation/Applicative Order Evaluation
   
   > The evaluation model of "fully expand and then reduce" is called normal order evaluation, and the one used in current interpreters, where the arguments are evaluated before application, is called applicative order evaluation.

3. Lisp Naming Convention - Using '-' for Function Names
   
   > There are several reasons for using '-' as the separator for Scheme function names:
   > 
   > 1. Scheme allows flexible naming of identifiers, permitting special characters like '-'.
   > 2. Languages in the Lisp family recommend using '-' rather than '_' to connect multi-word identifiers.
   > 3. '-' is easier to discern than '_', making identifiers like 'a-plus-b' more readable than 'a_plus_b'.
   > 4. Scheme's syntax itself includes '-', such as in 'define-syntax'.
   > 5. Using '-' aligns with the traditions and conventions of Scheme and Lisp.

4. Linear Iteration - Maintaining a Finite Number of States
   
   > ```scheme
   > (define (fib n)
   >   (fib-iter 1 0 n))
   > 
   > (define (fib-iter a b count)
   >   (if (= count 0)
   >       b
   >       (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
   > ```
   > 
   > Why is the `fib-iter` function called linear iteration:
   > 
   > 1. The `fib-iter` function is an iterative function with three parameters, where `a` and `b` represent the first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence, and `count` indicates how many more Fibonacci numbers need to be computed.
   > 
   > 2. During each iteration, the `fib-iter` function calculates the next Fibonacci number (`a + b`) and updates `a` to the previous value of `b`, and `b` to the previous calculation result. This is why it's called linear iteration, as it maintains only two states (`a` and `b`) during each iteration, without creating additional recursive call frames.
   > 
   > 3. When `count` reaches zero, the iteration stops, and the final result, `b`, is returned. This serves as the termination condition for the iteration.
   > 
   > Therefore, although the `fib-iter` function uses function recursion (calling itself during each iteration), it's called linear iteration because it maintains a finite number of states and doesn't create a large stack of recursive function calls, which is a characteristic of linear iteration. This approach is often more efficient than direct recursion because it avoids the overhead of many function calls.

5. Runtime, Steps, and Algorithm Complexity
   
   > Through testing three versions of the search-for-primes function, we find that using algorithm complexity or calculating the number of steps cannot predict the program's runtime completely.
   > 
   > First, even if we can accurately calculate the number of steps the program takes, the program's speed is still influenced by other factors, such as the speed of the computer, system resource usage, or the optimization level of the compiler/interpreter. The same program can run at different speeds under different conditions, so calculating the number of steps can provide useful reference information about the program's behavior, but it cannot completely and accurately predict the program's runtime.
   > 
   > On the other hand, algorithm complexity goes further than calculating the number of stepsâ€”it considers the rate of growth. For example, when we say that the complexity of algorithm A is higher than that of algorithm B, it means that algorithm A requires more resources (time or space) for computation than algorithm B.
   > 
   > In general, algorithms with lower complexity tend to run faster in practice. Sometimes, the difference may not be noticeable for small inputs, but as the input size grows, the advantage of low complexity becomes evident.

6. Passing Procedures as Arguments or Returning Procedures - These procedures capable of operating on other procedures are called **higher-order procedures**.

7. Naming Lambda Procedures
   
   > For those learning Lisp, using a name that's more explicit than lambda, such as "make-procedure," might seem clearer. However, habits die hard, and this notation is derived from lambda calculus, a mathematical notation introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in 1941. It provides a rigorous foundation for studying functions and function application. Lambda calculus has become a mathematical cornerstone for the semantics of programming languages.
